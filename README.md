# Git-GitHub-Branches-and-Flow

This repository is meant to discover how the branches are used within the GitHub flow by following GitHub's tutorial on how to create a new branch, edit it, commit the changes, pull them and finally merge those changes into the main branch.

It is part of the 4th Git/GitHub quests of the Wild Code School bootcamp program.

Enjoy! :)
